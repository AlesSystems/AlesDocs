## Best Practices

### 1. Provide Clear Context
- Give specific instructions about what you want to achieve
- Include relevant code snippets when asking for help
- Mention the programming language and framework

### 2. Iterate and Refine
- Start with a basic prompt and refine based on results
- Ask follow-up questions for better understanding
- Request explanations for generated code

### 3. Verify Generated Code
- Always review and test AI-generated code
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Ensure code follows your project's style guidelines

### 4. Use for Learning
- Ask the AI to explain concepts you don't understand
- Request alternative approaches to problems
- Learn new patterns and best practices

## Getting Started

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Choose Your AI Tool**
   - Evaluate tools based on your needs and budget
   - Consider IDE integration requirements
   - Check language and framework support

2. **Configure Your IDE**
   - Install necessary extensions/plugins
   - Set up API keys if required
   - Configure keyboard shortcuts for efficiency

3. **Start with Simple Tasks**
   - Begin with code completion suggestions
   - Try generating unit tests
   - Ask for documentation help

## Tips and Tricks

### Effective Prompting

```markdown
# Instead of:
"Write a function to sort"

# Try:
"Write a Python function that takes a list of dictionaries and sorts them by a specified key in ascending or descending order. Include type hints and docstring."
```

### Common Use Cases

- **Code Generation**: Describe the functionality you need
- **Bug Fixing**: Paste error messages and relevant code
- **Refactoring**: Ask for cleaner/more efficient implementations
- **Testing**: Request test cases for existing functions
- **Documentation**: Generate docstrings and README content

### Workflow Integration

1. Use AI for boilerplate code
2. Let AI suggest optimizations
3. Generate test cases automatically
4. Create documentation efficiently
5. Debug with AI assistance
